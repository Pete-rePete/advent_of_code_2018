# Year #1 

First time I'm doing Advent of Code, I'm a little late to the game but I thoroughly enjoy it.
My coding skills + algorithm design are still a little shaky, and the code can sometimes be messy, but hey we all begin somewhere. 

I'm not sure if anyone will actually read this, but any tips/suggestions are most welcome for:

 - speed
 - readability
 - redundant/superfluous code

### Day 15:
Completed with a bit of help from reddit on the "find nearest targets" and calculating distances. Once I learned it from some other people's code it seemed so obvious.

I didn't look too hard, but among the 2 solutions I looked at neither had a large 'Unit' class. Thought it could be fun to code from the unit's perspective.

Very satisfied I got my code working with no help beyond the aforementioned "finding nearest targets". (though I probably copied some stuff without noticing, I DID read most of the code afterall)
